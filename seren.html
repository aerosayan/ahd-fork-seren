	  <p>SEREN is a new astrophysical Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics 
	    code developed by researchers in Cardiff University and the 
	    University of Sheffield.  SEREN was designed to investigate 
	    star and planet formation problems using self-gravitating 
	    hydrodynamics simulations of molecular clouds, star-forming cores, 
	    and protostellar disks.  </p>
	  
	  <p>SEREN is written in Fortran 95/2003 with a modular philosophy 
	    for adding new features into the code.  Each feature can be easily 
	    activated or deactivated by way of setting options in the Makefile 
	    before compiling the code.  This has the added benefit of allowing 
	    unwanted features to be removed at the compilation stage 
	    resulting in a smaller and faster executable program.  SEREN is 
	    written with OpenMP directives to allow parallelisation on 
	    shared-memory architecture.  A MPI version of SEREN is 
            currently in development. </p>

          <p>SEREN was written by David Hubber, Chris Batty, Andrew McLeod.
            Contributions to the code have also been provided by 
            Anthony Whitworth, Thomas Bisbas, Dimitrios Stamatellos, 
            Stefanie Walch, Krisada Rawiraswattana and Simon Goodwin. </p>
