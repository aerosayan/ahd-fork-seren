How to use the 'joinsims' and 'joinlots.py' program and script
==============================================================

joinsims joins a single set of MPI files together. If you have,
say, the following files from a run with 4 tasks:

FF.0001.MPI.0
FF.0001.MPI.1
FF.0001.MPI.2
FF.0001.MPI.3

The 'basename' is FF.0001 for this set of files.

Joinsims can be run with no arguments, in which case the
program will prompt for the required information.

The syntax for calling joinsims on the command line is:

joinsims BASENAME N OUTPUTNAME [overwrite]

BASENAME - The basename of the files to join (see above)
N - The number of tasks used (the number of files to join)
OUTPUTNAME - The output file wanted (often this is best
             set to the same thing as BASENAME
overwrite - Set to 'yes' or 'no' if you want the program
            to overwrite existing files or not. The
            default is to prompt if a file already exists.
            You can also set to 'r', which overwrites an
            existing file and DELETES the old files.

==============================================================

joinlots.py

Joinlots.py is a Python script to automate usage of joinsims
for cases where you have lots of files. For example, if you
have files:

FF.0001.MPI.xx
FF.0002.MPI.xx
FF.0003.MPI.xx
FF.0004.MPI.xx

where xx represents all of the MPI task files for each output
of a simulation, then all of these outputs can be combined with
one command. Here the BASENAME would be FF instead of FF.0001
as we want to combine multiple sets of files into files which
will be named (to follow the previous example:

FF.0001
FF.0002
FF.0003
FF.0004

The syntax for calling joinlots.py is:

joinlots.py BASENAME [overwrite]

BASENAME - generally the run_id of the simulation, see above
overwrite - Set to 'yes' or 'no' if you want the script to
            overwrite existing files or not. Alternatively use
            'r' to overwrite files and remove the originals.
            THE DEFAULT WILL OVERWRITE WITHOUT PROMPTING, AND
            REMOVE ALL FILES OLDER THAN 120 SECONDS.
