	  <h2 class="post-title">Astrophysics</h2>
	  <p> SEREN was designed with solving astrophysical problems such as 
	  star formation and planet formation in mind.  Although SEREN can 
	  be used as a generic SPH code to simulate different types of 
	  astrophysical phenomena, the incorporated algorithms are 
	  specialist routines to investigate a particular facit or star 
	  formation.  We briefly discuss the kinds of simulations performed 
	  using SEREN, the physics and algorithms used in each simulation, 
	  and the relevance of the simulations to astrophysics.</p>
  
	  <h2 class="post-title">Turbulent Molecular Cloud Cores</h2>
	  <p> Observations of the morphology and line-width profiles of 
	    star-forming regions suggest that the motion the gas is turbulent, 
	    rather than quiescent (e.g. 
	    <a href=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1981MNRAS.194..809L>Larson 1981</a>).
	    While the origin of astrophysical turbulence is hotly debated 
	    (e.g. hydrodynamical instabilities, magneto-hydrodynamic 
	    instabilities, radiative and 
	    mechanical feedback, etc..), the effects of turbulence in 
	    molecular clouds can be studied using hydrodynamical simulations.
	    Various authors have studied various instances of turbulence 
	    in star formation using SPH such as driven turbulence in 
	    molecular clouds and undriven turbulence in 
	    star-forming cores.
	  </p>

	  
	  <h2 class="post-title">Planetary Disks</h2>
	  <p> Planets are believed to form from dusty gas disks that condense 
	    from the ambient material the protostar itself is being formed. 
	    Prestellar cores typically have a small amount of angular 
	    momentum.  As the prestellar core collapses, angular momentum 
	    must be conserved unless there is some mechanism that can transfer 
	    some angular momentum to external material (e.g. jets).  Low 
	    angular momentum gas will form the central protostar.  High 
	    angular momentum gas cannot collapse and forms a centrifugally 
	    supported disk.  Depending on various factors, this disk may 
	    fragment to form secondary objects such as lower mass companion 
	    stars, brown dwarfs or planets, or simply disperse slowly due 
	    to accretion onto the central protostar and evaporation.
	  </p>


	  <h2 class="post-title">Triggered Star Formation</h2>
	  <p> Star formation is a complicated non-linear process where 
	    feedback from the formation of other stars can, depending on 
	    many factors, either trigger the formation of a new generation 
	    of stars or supress any subsequent formation by destroying the 
	    natal cloud. Feedback in star formation can be due to i) winds 
	    from the atmospheres of new protostars, ii) highly collomated 
	    bipolar jets, iii) ionizing UV radiation from high-mass 
	    protostars.  
	  </p>

	  <p> SEREN uses the HEALPix algorithm to model the ionizing flux 
	    from high-mass stars 
	    (<a href=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009A%26A...497..649B>Bisbas et al. 2009</a>).
